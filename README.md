TASKS:

1) Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs.

2) Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice).

3) Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there.

4) Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component.

5) Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method).

6) Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event.

7) Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput.

8) Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username.

9) Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets.
